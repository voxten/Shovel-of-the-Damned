  - "Access cards are divided into several levels:\nLevel 0 \u2013 Guest\r\nLevel
    1 \u2013 Worker\r\nLevel 2 \u2013 General Staff\r\nLevel 3 \u2013 Senior Staff\r\nLevel
    4 \u2013 Admin Staff\nLevel S - Security (cannot upgrade!!!)\n\nAccess cards
    are extremely important \u2013 do not lose them!"
  - They allow movement throughout the laboratory via an infrared detection system.
    As long as the card is visible (e.g., clipped to your clothing), doors will open
    automatically.
  - "Cards can be upgraded to a higher level. To do this, you'll need a valid access
    code. This code changes with each use, so even if it's leaked, unauthorized users
    won\u2019t be able to exploit it."
  - To upgrade your card, use the card terminal located at the reception desk.
  - 'Please note: the system is new and may behave unpredictably. Always carry your
    pager with you so manual access can be granted if necessary.'
