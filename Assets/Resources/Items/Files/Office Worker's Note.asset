  noteContent:
  - "Looks like I\u2019m being transferred to the technical department. I have an
    engineering degree and I\u2019ve worked with generators before, so it shouldn\u2019t
    be a problem.\nThis \u201Cpromotion\u201D caught me a bit off guard \u2014 I
    asked around before, and they said there were no open positions. Now suddenly
    there is. Apparently one of the workers has been overworking himself and they
    want to give him some rest.\n"
  - "Tomorrow I\u2019m supposed to upgrade my access card and go through safety training.\n\nP.S.
    If someone finds this note, it probably won\u2019t matter anyway, so... 1246
    that's my code."
