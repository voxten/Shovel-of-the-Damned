  - "They pay me by the body. I told myself it was just a job \u2014 clean the corpse,
    cut it down, sort the parts. Simple.\n\nBut now, there are too many. No names,
    no histories. Just meat.\n\nI know where it goes. I\u2019ve heard it feeding.\n\nAnd
    I keep working. For the money.\nGod help me."
