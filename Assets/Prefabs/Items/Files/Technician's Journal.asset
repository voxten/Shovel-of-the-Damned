  noteContent:
  - "They got Michael a radio. At least now he has something to help him unwind a
    bit during his breaks. And good for him \u2014 he deserved it. That guy seems
    to live for work these days. He\u2019s handling the entire shift on his own."
  - "Paul and I try not to bother him when he finally gets a rest. But how much longer
    can this go on? If something goes wrong, if Michael misses something, it could
    lead to a serious failure. And we can\u2019t afford to lose the generators.\n"
  - "I\u2019m worried about him. Really."
