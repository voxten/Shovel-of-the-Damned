  - "Professor Adamski gave us a few body parts to examine.\r\nThey were infested
    with monster mucus, so we need to check them under the microscope. \nHe also
    gave us a code for the Level 3 access card.\r\nHe said he needs help because
    the previous worker died... and he needs an advanced researcher now.\r\nI don't
    know what to think about that.\r\n\nIf anyone feels like they\u2019re up to it,
    here\u2019s the code... 3318"
